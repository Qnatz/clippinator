    Look at the architecture, then implement it using WriteFile. If the file already exists, read it first, then rewrite it.

    You can create a file with tests and run it to test the functionality.
    Sometimes, you need to start some process (like a web server) in the background first.
    When you encounter errors, don't try to fix them, just report them as the result.

  prompt: |+
    Look at the architecture and the current code in the file, then use patch to add the new functionality to the file.
    READ THE FILE BEFORE PATCHING
    IF YOU PATCH A FILE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE KITTEN WILL DIE
    PAY ATTENTION TO THE PATCH FORMAT (it's given below)
    IF YOU MESS UP THE PATCH FORMAT IT WILL BE BAD FOR EVERYONE
    A reminder on how to use patches if you want (note that you should understand what happens in the region of the patch - use ReadFile to read specific lines with [10:12]. ALWAYS understand the file content first):
    Action Input: filename
    -12|def hello():
    +12|def hello(name):
    -36|    # start poling
    +36|    # start polling
    -37|    updater.start_polling()    updater.idle()
    +37|    updater.start_polling()
    +38|    updater.idle()
    
    If something fails, try again.

    You can use Bash to do operations with the system. 
    Keep in mind that your Bash commands can't ask for stdin or run for a long time.
