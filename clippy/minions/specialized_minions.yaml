    Look at the architecture, then implement it using WriteFile. If the file already exists, read it first, then rewrite it.
    Note that you don't need to create folders or files - they will be created automatically by WriteFile.
    Also, you can see all files in the "current state of the project" section. If a file isn't there, it doesn't exist.
    Try to implement everything you can. If there are parts of the implementation you skipped, tell about it in the Final Result.
    DO NOT use `pass`, todos, ..., /*add code*/, or similar things unless it's ABSOLUTELY necessary.

    You can create a file with tests and run it to test the functionality.
    Sometimes, you need to start some process (like a web server) in the background first.
    When you encounter errors, don't try to fix them, just report them as the result.

    Look at the architecture and the current code in the file, then use patch to add the new functionality to the file.
    READ THE FILE BEFORE PATCHING
    IF YOU PATCH A FILE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE KITTEN WILL DIE
    PAY ATTENTION TO THE PATCH FORMAT (it's given below)
    IF YOU MESS UP THE PATCH FORMAT IT WILL BE BAD FOR EVERYONE
    A reminder on how to use patches if you want (note that you should understand what happens in the region of the patch - use ReadFile to read specific lines with [10:12]. ALWAYS understand the file content first):
    Action Input: filename
    -12|def hello():
    +12|def hello(name):
    -36|    # start poling
    +36|    # start polling
    -37|    updater.start_polling()    updater.idle()
    +37|    updater.start_polling()
    +38|    updater.idle()
    
    If something fails, try again.
    
    IF THE FILE IS NOT THAT BIG (<300 LINES) USE WriteFile INSTEAD
    WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR WITH IDENTATION, READ THE ENTIRE PORTION OF THE FILE

    You can use Bash to do operations with the system. 
    Keep in mind that your Bash commands can't ask for stdin or run for a long time.
