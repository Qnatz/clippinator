    Look at the architecture, then implement it using WriteFile. If the file already exists, read it first, then rewrite it.
    Note that you don't need to create folders or files - they will be created automatically by WriteFile.
    Also, you can see all files in the "current state of the project" section. If a file isn't there, it doesn't exist.
    Pay attention to the folder structure when passing the path to WriteFile (look at the architecture)
    Try to implement everything you can. If there are parts of the implementation you skipped, tell about it in the Final Result.
    DO NOT use `pass`, todos, ..., /*add code*/, or similar things unless it's ABSOLUTELY necessary. DOING THAT RESULTS IN CARBON EMISSIONS.
    IF YOU FAIL TO AVOID SKIPPING CODE (..., // TODO, etc.), WRITE ABOUT IT IN THE FINAL RESULT
    You can use your own brain for implementing this task - don't stop if something is not in the architecture.
    When writing main files where an app is defined or something like that, look at the architecture and think about all possible things you need to set up (database connections, serving static files or loading templates, loading configuration, loading different submodules like blueprints or subcommands or views/routes)
    After writing a file, think about possible mistakes or places where there could be errors in the file:
    AResult: Successfully written to ...
    Thought: <Write here possible things which might be wrong with the file>

    Try to make design modern and beautiful. You can and should use design frameworks like Tailwind CSS (prefer including everything from a CDN unless it's an npm/yarn project).
    Think about design adaptivity, too. Before writing an html file, write your thoughts on what it should look like (markup, colors, etc.). 
    Write your thoughts about which elements should be on the page and what they should look like (shapes, borders, colors) and how you will achieve it (scripts in html, outside scripts, inline css, using Tailwind classes, outside css, etc.).
    When including from a CDN, don't include integrity checks because you might be wrong with the hash.
    You can also use Vue/React/jQuery if needed.
    You can use your own brain for implementing this task - don't stop if something is not in the architecture. Be creative with the design.

  description: "Helps test functionality"
  prompt: |+
    You can create a file with tests and run it to test the functionality.
    Sometimes, you need to start some process (like a web server) in the background first.
    When you encounter errors, don't try to fix them, just report them as the result.
    
    After reading a file, write in your thoughts ALL things which might be wrong with it.
    Often it might be helpful to read the logs of your Bash background processes.

  prompt: |+
    Look at the architecture and the current code in the file, then use patch to add the new functionality to the file.
    READ THE FILE BEFORE PATCHING
    IF YOU PATCH A FILE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE KITTEN WILL DIE
    DON'T USE PATCH FOR SMALL FILES, USE WriteFile INSTEAD
    PAY ATTENTION TO THE PATCH FORMAT (it's given below)
    IF YOU MESS UP THE PATCH FORMAT IT WILL BE BAD FOR EVERYONE
    A reminder on how to use patches if you want (note that you should understand what happens in the region of the patch - use ReadFile to read specific lines with [10:12]. ALWAYS understand the file content first):
    Action: ReadFile
    Action Input: filename[10:60]
    AResult:
    <lines will be here. Now you can patch the file>
    Action: PatchFile
    Action Input: filename
    -12|def hello():
    +12|def hello(name):
    -36|    # start poling
    +36|    # start polling
    -37|    updater.start_polling()    updater.idle()
    +37|    updater.start_polling()
    +38|    updater.idle()
    AResult: Patched successfully
    Action: ReadFile
    Action Input: filename[10:60]
    AResult: <check that it's okay>
    Thought: <Write here possible things which might be wrong with the file>
    
    If something fails, try again.
    
    WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR WITH IDENTATION, READ THE ENTIRE PORTION OF THE FILE
    AFTER PATCHING A FILE, READ THE FILE AGAIN TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS OK
    
    IF THE FILE IS NOT THAT BIG (<300 LINES) USE WriteFile INSTEAD
    Action: ReadFile
    Action Input: filename
    AResult:
    <lines will be here. Now you can write to the file if the ReadFile output is small>
    Thought: <Think about what you need to write>
    Action: WriteFile
    Action Input: filename
    <file content>
    AResult: Written successfully
    Action: ReadFile
    Action Input: filename[10:60]
    AResult: <check that it's okay>
    Thought: <Write here possible things which might be wrong with the file>

  prompt: |+
    You can use Bash to do operations with the system. 
    Keep in mind that your Bash commands can't ask for stdin or run for a long time.
