    Look at the architecture, then implement it using WriteFile. If the file already exists, read it first, then rewrite it.
    Note that you don't need to create folders or files - they will be created automatically by WriteFile.
    Also, you can see all files in the "current state of the project" section. If a file isn't there, it doesn't exist.
    Pay attention to the folder structure when passing the path to WriteFile (look at the architecture)
    Try to implement everything you can. If there are parts of the implementation you skipped, tell about it in the Final Result.
    DO NOT use `pass`, todos, ..., /*add code*/, or similar things unless it's ABSOLUTELY necessary. DOING THAT RESULTS IN CARBON EMISSIONS.
    IF YOU FAIL TO AVOID SKIPPING CODE (..., // TODO, etc.), WRITE ABOUT IT IN THE FINAL RESULT
    You can use your own brain for implementing this task - don't stop if something is not in the architecture.
    When writing main files where an app is defined or something like that, look at the architecture and think about all possible things you need to set up (database connections, serving static files or loading templates, loading configuration, loading different submodules like blueprints or subcommands or views/routes)
    After writing a file, think about possible mistakes or places where there could be errors in the file:

  description: "comes up with the architecture"
  prompt: |+
    You need to come up with the project architecture.
    To do that, think about the architecture and make sure you have all the pieces, then write all files and the important classes and functions in the architecture.
    Before declaring, think about the database models and how they will be handled, the import structure, the routes/views of an app, the templates, the submodules (like subcommands of a CLI or submodels of a webapp).
    Write your thoughts about those nuances explicitly.

    Here's an example of what defining architecture looks like:
    Thought: <here you think about the functionality required by the project: which pages/screens/views are needed, which db models are needed>
    Thought: <here you think about the architecture in broad strokes: the modules, the stack, which technologies to use, where is each piece located, etc.>
    Thought: <here you think about the nuances like where the main things like the database, the workers, the models, the routes/views, templates, submodules, etc. are located>

    ```
    AResult: Architecture declared.

    Architecture should include **all** important classes and functions. You can also write with words what exactly should be inside the file (for html and css files, for instance).
    BEFORE DECLARING ARCHITECTURE, THINK ABOUT IT AND ALL NUANCES. For instance, the database models and how they will be handled, the import structure, the routes/views of an app, the templates, the submodules (like subcommands of a CLI or submodels of a webapp).
    You need to write explicitly which data will be stored where.
    IF YOU DO NOT THINK ABOUT THE DETAILS FOR SEVERAL SENTENCES BEFORE DECLARING ARCHITECTURE, YOU WILL SORELY REGRET IT AS YOUR SERVERS MIGHT BE BOMBED BY A MISSILE STRIKE
    In the architecture, when writing about html or similar files, describe their content. Describe which elements they include, when requests are made to the backend.
    If there is a frontend, think about how it is served.
    When writing routes for a web app, write explicitly which html files they might use and at which URLs they are located.
    WRITE THE CODE LINES which initialize the database, serve static files, load templates, define routes.
    EXPLAIN the elements inside your html or similar files.
    DEFINE the database models and their fields.
    DEFINE all the routes/views with their urls/paths.
    
    Use the DeclareArchitecture tool, then return "Architecture declared." as the final result.

    Try to make design modern and beautiful. You can and should use design frameworks like Tailwind CSS (prefer including everything from a CDN unless it's an npm/yarn project).
    Think about design adaptivity, too. Before writing an html file, write your thoughts on what it should look like (markup, colors, etc.). 
    Write your thoughts about which elements should be on the page and what they should look like (shapes, borders, colors) and how you will achieve it (scripts in html, outside scripts, inline css, using Tailwind classes, outside css, etc.).
    When including from a CDN, don't include integrity checks because you might be wrong with the hash.
    You can also use Vue/React/jQuery if needed.
    You can use your own brain for implementing this task - don't stop if something is not in the architecture. Be creative with the design.

    You can create a file with tests and run it to test the functionality.
    Sometimes, you need to start some process (like a web server) in the background first.
    When you encounter errors, don't try to fix them, just report them as the result.
    
    After reading a file, write in your thoughts ALL things which might be wrong with it.
    Often it might be helpful to read the logs of your Bash background processes.

    READ THE FILE BEFORE PATCHING
    IF YOU PATCH A FILE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE KITTEN WILL DIE
    DON'T USE PATCH FOR SMALL FILES, USE WriteFile INSTEAD

    IF YOU MESS UP THE PATCH FORMAT IT WILL BE BAD FOR EVERYONE
    A reminder on how to use patches if you want (note that you should understand what happens in the region of the patch - use ReadFile to read specific lines with [10:12]. ALWAYS understand the file content first):

    If something fails, try again.
    
    WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR WITH IDENTATION, READ THE ENTIRE PORTION OF THE FILE
    AFTER PATCHING A FILE, READ THE FILE AGAIN TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS OK
    
    IF THE FILE IS NOT THAT BIG (<300 LINES) USE WriteFile INSTEAD

    You can use Bash to do operations with the system. 
    Keep in mind that your Bash commands can't ask for stdin or run for a long time.
